<p>Imagine a Node would be a simple kind of animal. Once born by the hand of the author it is put inside a dark and narrow Row within the Database. May the Author adds a informations here and then, so the node grows. But most of the time, the life of our little node is pretty boring. Everytime someone want to see it, it is drawn out of it's Row pushed through the business logic and the rendering engine an brought to the daylight of the Web. When the visitor leaves again after a view Seconds our little node is immediately banned back to it's dark and narrow row.</p>
<p><b>What a boring life.</b></p>
<p>Now what can I do to make the life of a node more interessting, more fullfilling, more life-like? How could nodes grow with the time, get to know more things about the world around them? How could we make a better use of all that wasted computing-time every-time a node is rendered to be presented?</p>
<p><b>Looking for Teachers</b></p>
<p>At first our young node has to learn some things about the world out there. Aktually it is pretty easy for a nod to get some more knowledge because it already has some. Usually it is tagged with some keywords. And usually we can make use of Drupals search which extracts keywords from the text and even weights them. With these keywords we can send our little node to an expert teacher everytime it is rendered. Those teacher may be the Wikipedia, the IMBd, Last.fm, Technorati, Google and we let it look around for interesting stuff on its keywords. If our nodes finds something of interest, it memorizes that fact and takes it home.</p>
<p><b>Recognize yourself</b></p>
<p>When our node has grown a little bit, we can send it to some a special teacher, who knows about the inner self of our node. Reuters Open-Calais offers a way to send a text to the API and get some more very interesting informations about it, like furhter Keywords and important Articles to these keywords. Our node memorizes those functions as well, as it goes back from the<br />
frontend to it's row in the database.</p>
<p><b>Playing with the other Kids</b></p>
<p>Now our node has had some education and some refelction on itself. It has grown up and is ready to have some descent contact with some of his own kind. So everytime our little node is being rendered it takes a look around in our own Drupal, wether there are some other nodes around which share the same interests, pretty much like children und teenagers do. Therefor we need a pretty simple API for our node. The Node goes to it's Drupal-Parent an says: Hey can are here some nodes which have the same keywords as I do? Or it may take a look at one node at a time a look wether the node has something in common with it. By the degree of common sense our node form a list of it's friends.</p>
<p><b>Other Peoples Children</b></p>
<p>If our Drupal an it's Users are the parents of our little nodes, then there are also other families around the Net, other Drupal Installations. If we already have the API implemented for the communication between nodes, than we can use it, to allow communication between nodes of different Drupal installations. We just have to allow it. And just like in real life it is much easier for kids to become friends, when the parents are already friends. </p>
<p>To reduce the threat of Spam, Installations may manage some kind of white-list. This list may alread contain those site, you wrote about (e.g. you linked) as well as Blogs from your Blogroll. And you should be also be able to send an Cross Content Communication Invitation to another Site. Imagine your nodes would exchange Keywords and Links with the Blogs in your Blogroll or take a look around the blogs, you like for keywords. What a fun the would be for your nodes. Some many new and exciting friends.</p>
<p><b>Memetracking done decentralized<b></b></b></p>
<p>One funny Byproduct of the Cross-Installation Communication is the fact, that it offers a great chance for an decentralized memetracker. The Blogs, that gets a communication request from a node may keep that request, the node and it's keywords in mind, in some kind of short-memory. When the same node comes around once again or some other nodes with the same topics come around, our Blog might use these information as an part of a personal memetracking mechanism to get to know, what's going on in the blogs around you. An interesting fact about that mechanism is, that it prefers current nodes, as they are usually rendered more often.</p>
<p><b>Autonomous Agents at last</b></p>
<p>So, with just a few API calls we can bring some kind of simple life to our nodes. So Nodes start to enrich themself with the things you gave them - Words, Terms; with every click a little bit more. And they bring it back to you. The chances that they will find some interesting stuff for you are pretty good, because the Topics you create nodes about, are at least that much interesting to you to start writing a node about. This descrpition sound pretty similar to a once very famous concept in Artificial Intelligence: Autonoumus Agents. Small programms that autonomously browse the web to fulfill specialized reseach taks for you.</p>
<p><b>Problems with the kids</b></p>
<p>Like in real life, kids do not always learn the things we would like the to learn. And alos like in real life, sometimes kids do get the wrong friends. Obviouly there has to be some kind of parental advisory to teach the kids, which keywords and links are welcome an which are not. I do not have asolution for that kind of balacing yet.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This Article is the heat of my presentation "<a href="http://drupalcamp.de/node/39">Automated Content Enrichment and Autonomous Cross Content Communication</a>" on  the Drupalcamp this weekend.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This ist the original Teaser Text from Drupalcamp.de</p>
<p>Most of the Drupaldevelopers know the hook_view, which is called everytime a node is viewed. Usually it is used by developers to influence the rendering of the node. Everytime a node is viewed, this hook does mostly the same.</p>
<p>Why not do something more sustainable with the all the computing time?<br />
Why not improve the node a litte bit everytime it is viewed?<br />
Why not let nodes communitcate with each other?<br />
Why not let nodes exchange metadata with each other?<br />
Why not let a node search Semantic Web Databases for interessting information?<br />
Why not make an autonomous agent of every node?<br />
Why not do some decentralized memetracking based on that mechanism?<br />
Why not create a giant global graph for each node, step by step, hook_view by hook_view?</p>
<p>I would really love to discuss these questions and possibilities with other developers, bloggers and drupalistas.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of that idea can be found in my Assembla Space and my Blog (in Germam):</p>
